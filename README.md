# Lantern

Lantern is a self-contained Rust agent that provides local orchestration for AI coding squads. It runs on each developer machine, serving as both the MCP server for agents and the local runtime authority backed by Temporal.

## Architecture

Lantern combines three functions into one deployable unit:

- **MCP server**: Serves tools (`devorch_report_status`, `devorch_peer_message`, `devorch_query_team_state`, `devorch_get_setup_instructions`) for agents to interact with the runtime
- **Local runner**: Manages terminal windows (iTerm2), git worktrees, process execution, and recovery
- **Temporal client**: Drives all runtime state through the local native Temporal instance (127.0.0.1:8243) with SQLite projections for diagnostics (Docker Temporal is strictly unsupported)

No remote server dependency. Deploy on N machines, each runs independently.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Palmetto-Interactive-LLC/m7-lantern-code.git
cd m7-lantern-code
./scripts/install.sh
source ~/.zshrc

lantern up
cd ~/Development/my-project
lantern startwork myproject 1 --agent claude
```
