**Lantern** is a self-contained Rust binary that orchestrates AI coding squads on your local machine—managing multiple agent processes, terminal windows, git worktrees, and workflow state with zero cloud dependencies.

## Why Lantern?

Multi-agent development needs coordination across specialized roles (code review, data design, security, UI, ops). Lantern consolidates this into one lightweight service: one command launches your entire squad, each agent gets an isolated terminal pane and git branch, and agents communicate via MCP tools.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
# Clone and build (requires Rust 1.70+, git, Temporal CLI)
git clone https://github.com/Palmetto-Interactive-LLC/pi-code-orchestrator.git
cd pi-code-orchestrator
./scripts/install.sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Launch a Squad

```bash
# Default: headed orchestrator + 8 headless specialists (claude agent)
lantern up
lantern startwork myproject

# Solo Goose mode (single focused agent, no orchestrator overhead)
lantern startwork myproject --agent goose

# Different agent CLI
lantern startwork myproject --agent codex
```

### Common Commands

```bash
lantern doctor        # Health check (Rust, Temporal, iTerm2, git, agents)
lantern status        # Show all active squads
lantern stopwork myproject-1  # Tear down a squad
```

## How It Works

- **MCP Server**: Agents report status, send peer messages, query team state via `devorch_*` tools
- **Local Runner**: Creates iTerm2 window with colored panes (one per role), git worktrees for isolation
- **State Store**: SQLite at `~/.lantern/data/relay/lantern.db` (local, no cloud)
- **Optional Temporal**: Dev server at `127.0.0.1:8243` for workflow logging (Docker Temporal unsupported)
